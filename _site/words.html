    hold it back | hold me back
    dismantled me | connected me
    dismantled strength | complacent me

    watch it struggle | screech and rot
    let it squirm | mistaken me
    hold its tongue

    nothing else
    feel nothing else
    detached from earth
    but linked with chain
    an exercise in showing restraint
