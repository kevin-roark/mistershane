        I'm not an easy man to love. I admit that. It took years for my wife to fully accept me for who I am.
        Probably because it took me so long to be honest with her. Sometimes it's hard to explain what you're feeling.
        To put it into words. I think with time I learned to show it in other ways.
        I made an effort, and she saw that, and I think that made all the difference.
        Sure, we have our "off" days. Who doesn't?
        But our marriage is thriving because, even in the hardest moments - those nights when we fought like cats and dogs - she never lost sight of the man that I truly am.
        The man that she fell in love with. I might not be the best with words. I sure as hell have my flaws. But she accepts and loves me for who I am deep down.
        That's more than I could ever ask for from a person. But somehow I found that person - and she's waiting for me at home right now.
        She's my wife. And I'm the luckiest man in the world.
